		narrator, "“How do we do this?” Well! It’s not as simple as it may seem, but one way we protect the fish is to use different methods that help guide them towards safer migration routes.",
		
		narrator, "Before we start, there are a couple of things you should know to prepare yourself for this adventure.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/Capture.png",
		narrator, "To help explain differences in survival routes for young salmon, let’s divide the Delta into five “survival areas” that fish can inhabit until they eventually reach the “survival finish line” near Three Mile Slough where they’ll go through the San Francisco Bay out towards the ocean.",
		narrator, "These five areas are: Yolo Bypass, Sacramento River, Central Delta, San Joaquin River, and South Delta. However, not all of them provide a safe habitat for the young salmon. ",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/CaptureYB.png",

		narrator, "A weir is a low dam built across a river to raise the level of water upstream or to regulate flow. We utilize the Fremont Weir in a similar way. It allows the Yolo Bypass to flood with water from the Sacramento River to prevent flooding of populated areas other side of the river.",
		narrator, "When the water level in the Sacramento River is high enough to flow over the Fremont Weir, the young salmon will have a choice to either enter the Yolo Bypass or stay in the Sacramento River area.",

		narrator, "Eventually the salmon in the Yolo Bypass have to travel towards the ocean as well. Although they may be larger and stronger than the salmon primarily traveling through the Sacramento River, they still have a similar chance for survival in the Delta.",

		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/Sutter_slough.jpg",
		narrator, "Two examples of this are Steamboat and Sutter Slough. These sloughs are branches of the Sacramento River that have some natural marsh or swamp-like areas connecting on the sides.",
		narrator, "Both sloughs are a separate path leading towards the ocean in comparison to staying in the Sacramento River. However, whether the salmon decide to continue their journey through Steamboat and Sutter Slough, or stay in the Sacramento River, the chance for survival remains fairly similar.",
		narrator, "This is because the salmon are prone to the same threats in both paths such as predators and weather conditions!",
		narrator, "It looks like the salmon have decided to stay in the Sacramento River!",
		narrator, "If the salmon are able to survive throughout the beginning portion of their adventure, they will eventually come across a major intersection, the Delta Cross Channel.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/Delta_cross_channel.jpg",
		narrator, "The Delta Cross Channel is a facility that allows the water to be diverted from the Sacramento River towards the Central and South Delta to improve the quality of water exported from the Delta. Operated by the CA Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the Delta Cross Channel is a short channel with two radial gates that, when open, allows water from the Sacramento River to flow through.",

If they are pushed towards the South Delta survival area they have a VERY small chance of surviving. Remember, in the South Delta there are a vast amount of different factors that can contribute to their death such as: longer migratory channels, pump intakes, warmer water, and the deadly predators. I don’t think opening the gate will work.",

Good decision!",
		narrator, "Usually, the gates, operated by U.S Bureau of Reclamation in coordination with DWR, are closed during the winter/spring due to it being the time period when young salmon, are likely to migrate. We want to save as many of these young salmon as possible, so we try to do everything in power to accomplish that goal.",
		narrator, "Now, the salmon travel along the Sacramento River until they reach the next obstacle in their path to the ocean, Georgiana Slough.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/georgiana_slough.jpg",
		narrator, "Although the Georgiana Slough is an important natural channel which provides habitat for many species of birds, fish, and other wildlife as well as a popular spot for recreational boats, it usually is not the best choice for young salmon. It is a longer path to the ocean, provides a greater chance for young salmon to deviate toward the South Delta, contains many predators, and overall creates a higher mortality rate for the young fish.",

		narrator, "To begin with, let’s talk about storage, and then we can talk about export and how they are tied together.",
		narrator, "So what does storing water mean? Well, it’s as the name entails. We have to store water so that during times with no rainfall and runoff we don’t run out of water.",
		narrator, "Storing water is a necessity to the well-being of the people.",
		narrator, "How do we store water then?",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/oroville_reservoir.png",
		narrator, "We use something called reservoirs. Reservoirs are large natural or artificial lakes that are used for water supply, flood control, and much more. California’s three largest reservoirs (Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom) release water that passes through the Delta on its way to users in the central and southern California.",
		narrator, "These reservoirs are vital to flood control and to controlling river flows into the Delta. Releasing water from the Delta also helps maintain Delta water quality by keeping the salty ocean water out of the Delta.",
		narrator, "This is because reservoirs are our main water collection facilities, and we determine how much water we can allocate towards each aspect of the Delta based off the amount of water in the reservoirs.",
		narrator, "If we did not have a method to store water, the possibility of running out of usable water would be higher.",
		narrator, "If we did not have a method to store water, the possibility of flooding would be higher.",
		narrator, "If we did not have a method to store water, the possibility of Delta salinity levels increasing too high to drink the water would be higher.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/folsom_reservoir.png",
		narrator, "As you may be able to tell, storage plays an important role in California’s water supply.",
		narrator, "For this game, let’s consider two important water levels in reservoir operations. First is the “dead pool” level. No reservoir can go below this level, because past the “dead pool”, it is impossible to release water from the reservoir outlets. The other level is the maximum water level to prevent overtopping of the dam and uncontrolled flooding downstream.",
		narrator, "Making sure the reservoirs don’t overflow and don’t drop to the dead pool level are some of the challenges that water managers have to deal with.",
		narrator, "However, it is also vital that we maintain some water in the reservoirs as a cushion against unknown future conditions. This can lead to some conflict.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/game_steam.png",
		narrator, "Sometimes, during droughts or dry years, all of the demands for water cannot be met which makes people relying on that water for their needs upset.",
		farmer, "Where is my WATER? I need to take care of my crops or they’ll die!",
		narrator, "During dry times, we need to deliver enough water for public health and safety, and other uses of water become secondary. This results in other users maybe only receiving a small portion of the water they want.",

		scene, 	"DWR_Game/assets/banks_pumping.png",
		narrator, "So, how do we get water to all those users south of the Delta? That’s where exports come in, so let’s learn about them!",
		narrator, "Fresh water supplies released from the upstream reservoirs flows into the Delta. Then we export water towards southern California and other areas in the state through the use of large pumps which can send up to 10,300 cubic feet per second (cfs) into an extensive system of canals.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/water_south.png",
		narrator, "Exporting water from the Delta lets us meet the demands of the people in the drier and more populated southern part of the state.",
		narrator, "The real question is, “How do we determine how much water we actually allocate towards agricultural, municipal, and industrial purposes?”",
		narrator, "There is no simple answer to this, but in a simple overview, most of our decisions are based around pre-existing contracts. These contracts help decide how much water needs to be exported through the pumps towards central and southern California.",
		narrator, "Exporting water not only allows us to meet the public’s demand, but also their safety. Without the devising a method to safely export water, the possibility of flooding would increase.",

		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/intrusion5.png",
		narrator, "Alright, let’s learn about water quality and how it affects the delta!",
		narrator, "What is water quality? Well, water quality can be thought of as a measure of the suitability of water for a particular use based on selected physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. For this game, we’ll be focusing on one of the physical aspects of water, salinity.",
		narrator, "Salinity is an easily noticeable property of water because anything with high levels of salinity will taste salty! It not only affects drinking water, but also irrigation and ecosystems, and our job at DWR is to make sure we deliver the freshest water to everyone.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/intrusion1.png",
		narrator, "In the Delta, salinity usually invades our water by tides from the ocean water. When export rates are high or river flows into the Delta are low, some of the ocean water can enter into the Delta and make it too salty. So, we have to take action to push that salt towards the ocean where it belongs.",
		narrator, "So, how do we do this?",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/intrusion2.png",
		narrator, "Before taking any direct action to help adjust the water quality, we have to acquire the data that proves the salinity levels are rising above an acceptable rate. To do this, we collect data continuously throughout the year and measure the electrical conductivity (EC) levels, a surrogate for salinity.",
		narrator, "After collecting and analyzing the data, decisions have to be made. The salinity data becomes one piece of a complex decision making process that looks at salinity levels, the amount of water available in reservoirs, water delivery obligations, and much more.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/intrusion3.png",
		narrator, "So, how do we do this? Don’t worry, I can teach you a general overview of what we do here!",
		narrator, "The gist of what is done to prevent the salinity levels from becoming too high is sending fresh water from the reservoirs to counteract the ocean water coming in. This way, we can prevent the salinity from intruding into the Delta and contaminating the quality of the water we send out to the community and the state as a whole. However, water released to push salt towards the ocean is not available for export south of the Delta.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/intrusion4.png",
		narrator, "In fact, we are required by state water quality regulations to maintain Delta water quality by delivering at least a minimum amount of water from the reservoirs for public health and safety. This is where the trickiness begins to show up.",
		narrator, "If the amount of water in the reservoirs is high, it doesn’t matter how much water is delivered out to the ocean because there will still be enough water to meet the public’s demand. However, if there is a very dry year, similar to the 2014-2015, it is very hard to meet those amounts mandated by law and meet the demands of the people.",
		scene, "DWR_Game/assets/intrusion6.png",
		narrator, "This leads farmers like Bill to get extremely upset.",
		farmer, "WHERE IS MY WATER? All my crops are going to die if I don’t get my water!",
		narrator, "You can clearly see Bill, like many others, is very upset to not be able to receive all of his water supply. Even though it may not be the optimal situation, it makes sense, because without using water to improve the salinity levels in the Delta the water people drink from the Delta would taste different.",
		narrator, "We have to follow regulations set by the state so that we have enough water to repel the salinity the tides from the ocean water bring in.",
